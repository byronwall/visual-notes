Follow these coding standards:

- Only modify the prisma schema. Always generate migrations via CLI. Never manually generate a migration.
- Always use `console.log` for debugging. When creating large code chunks add a couple console.log calls to help determine control flow and how thing run.
- Preview creating event handlers as `const handlerName = () => { ... }` and then using `onClick={handlerName}` in the component. Avoid inline event handlers unless they are very simple.
- Avoid `typeof import('...')` imports. Instead use `import {type ...} from '...'`.
- Avoid `any` types. Instead use more specific types when possible. If any must be used , add a comment in the output code explaining why.
- Imports should occur at the top of the file. Avoid lazy or deferred imports.
- Prefer early returns over nested if statements.
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
