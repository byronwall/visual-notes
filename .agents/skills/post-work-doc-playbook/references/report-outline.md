# Report Outline

Use this structure when creating a post-work implementation report.

## 1) Scope and Context

- What was requested
- What area/feature was changed
- Constraints (time, architecture, UX, compatibility, policy)

## 2) Major Changes Delivered

- List each major change
- Include affected files and behavior impact
- Mention what stayed intentionally unchanged

## 3) Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

For each key decision:

- Decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Why chosen
- Tradeoffs accepted

## 4) Problems Encountered and Resolutions

For each problem:

- Symptom
- Root cause
- Resolution
- Preventative action (if applicable)

## 5) Verification and Validation

- Commands run and pass/fail status
- Manual checks performed
- Gaps (checks not run, and why)

## 6) Process Improvements

- Improvements to implementation workflow
- Improvements to validation workflow
- Improvements to handoff/reporting workflow

## 7) Agent/Skill Improvements

- Missing instruction discovered
- Proposed AGENTS or skill update
- Why this would reduce future iteration churn

## 8) Follow-ups and Open Risks

- Outstanding tasks
- Known limitations
- Residual risks
- Suggested next actions with priority
