# Quality Checklist

Run this checklist before finalizing a post-work documentation file.

## Coverage

- Includes all required sections from the skill.
- Covers both "what changed" and "why it changed".
- Includes failed attempts or reversals when relevant.

## Evidence

- References concrete files touched.
- Names verification commands run.
- States explicit outcomes (pass/fail/not run).
- Distinguishes fact from inference.

## Decision Quality

- Captures major tradeoffs, not just final choice.
- Notes meaningful alternatives considered.
- Records constraints that shaped decisions.

## Problem Reporting

- Describes real problems encountered (or states none).
- Includes root cause and resolution details.
- Notes preventative action when known.

## Process/Agent Improvement

- Includes at least one process improvement insight when applicable.
- Includes at least one agent/skill improvement insight when applicable.
- Assigns where each improvement should be encoded (AGENTS, skill, script, checklist).

## Readability

- Uses scannable headings and bullets.
- Avoids vague wording ("improved", "fixed", "cleaned up") without specifics.
- Keeps section titles short and content actionable.

## Completeness

- States unresolved risks and follow-ups.
- Highlights any omitted validation.
- Provides enough context for another engineer to continue work safely.
