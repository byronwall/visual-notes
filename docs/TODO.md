# Main Todo

- Need to clean up HTML -> markdown pipeline - formatting + line breaks are busted - consider using HTML?
- add features around lasso and AI on top of the notes
- Need to be able to edit notes

## UMAP

- Need to see the params for the UMAP run
- Need to be able to change the params for the UMAP run
- Goal is to get more local movement instead of 2 large global clusters -- really want to create small pockets of commonness
- Probably need some sort of algo to separate things after the UMAP run

## Content

- Find all the notes with youtube links - organize those somehow

## Canvas

- Too much bunching once things render - need to allow spreading - crude force directed
- Give the stories a small square or rect layout - allow them to pack better
- Create a "focused" view that subsets based on locality and then allows me to work in there.

## Embeddings

- Likely thrown off by the repeating elements - may want to strip out markdown formatting and URLs?

## General

- Need some sort of large table view or something of the embeddings
