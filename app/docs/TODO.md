# TODO

## Site wide

- Get SSR working - ensure hydration is OK on page refreshes
- Need to harmonize the APIs into a handler
- Keep logs when hitting external APIs - just need a running total of how often we're hitting them

- Add better linters and integrate that into AI code generation
- Need to reduce max width - things are too wide
